#For network based on ens3 interface, we prepare latency matrix in top-triangular matrix or down tringular matrix. In terms of bandwidth, we prepare a diagonal matrix in which the 
#value of diagonal is zero and other values are symetric to diagonal of matrix.  

#latency-20.csv (4X) refers to when latency decreases by 20% from latency_def.csv (5X).
